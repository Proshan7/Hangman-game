# Hangman-game
Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. For each incorrect letter guess, a part of a "hangman" drawing (or a remaining guess counter) is lost. The player wins by revealing all letters of the word before running out of allowed wrong guesses; otherwise the player loses.
